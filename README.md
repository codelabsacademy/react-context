# Code Labs Academy - React router Example

## About this repository

This repository contains an example of using the [context api](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) for Unit 3 - Modern web development with ReactJS  of the web development bootcamp offered by [Code Labs Academy](https://codelabsacademy.com/). In this unit, we learn the major concepts of ReactJS, the most popular frontend Javascript framework, while providing challenges and homeworks for an optimal hands-on learning experience.

## Concepts covered

- Creating the context and and the [provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html#contextprovider) component to be used for accessing the context. ([view code](https://github.com/codelabsacademy/react-context/blob/main/src/context/ThemeContext.js))
- Wrapping the App component with our provider. ([view code](https://github.com/codelabsacademy/react-context/blob/main/src/index.js#L11L13))
- Using the context to add new functionality. (view code: [1](https://github.com/codelabsacademy/react-context/blob/main/src/components/Switch.js), [2](https://github.com/codelabsacademy/react-context/blob/main/src/components/Card.js))
